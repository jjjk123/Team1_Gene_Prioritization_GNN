## Run XGDAG using Docker

### Choose one of the paths

A) Dockerfile_quick_2025-05-14 - has the mods integrated for a quick deployment - but may stop working with future XGDAG releases.
B) Dockerfile - requires manual changes to the XGDAG code as accessed on 2025-05-14, detailed in the manual below.


### A - Instructions for Dockerfile_quick_2025-05-14

1. Download the XGDAG repository
```bash
mkdir test
cd test
git clone https://github.com/GiDeCarlo/XGDAG
```

2. Create 'Dockerfile' in the same dir and paste the contents from 'Dockerfile_quick_2025-05-14' and save
```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

3. Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t xgdag_test .
```

4. Run a Docker container
```bash
docker run -it xgdag_test
```

5. Test if XGDAG works
```bash
python TrainerScript.py
```




### B - Instructions for Dockerfile

1. Download the XGDAG repository
   
```bash
mkdir test
cd test
git clone https://github.com/GiDeCarlo/XGDAG
```

2. Modify the XGDAG codebase before it is copied into the container

#### Add a missing __init__.py file
```bash
touch XGDAG/SubgraphX/__init__.py
```
#### Fix relative import in SubgraphX.py
```bash
sed -i 's/from SubgraphXshapley/from .SubgraphXshapley/' XGDAG/SubgraphX/SubgraphX.py
```
3. Create a docker file - paste the content of provided 'Dockerfile' and save
```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

4. Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t xgdag_test .
```

5. Run a Docker container
```bash
docker run -it xgdag_test
```

6. Test if XGDAG works
```bash
python TrainerScript.py
```

## Further analysis

The above may allow to replicate the analysis in the paper, but performing an analysis of another disease requires further, undocumented, steps.
The script requires several input files, including a .gml interactome and .txt files with genes, scores and ranking, which appantly need to be generated with another tool - see here:
